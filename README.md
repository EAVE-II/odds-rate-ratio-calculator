###
This repo contains code that calculates estimators of odds and rate ratios in a simulated case-control study. These estimators needn't be equal, and this simulator allows the magnitude of the disprity to be seen in a simple simulation that uses piecewise constant event rates.

### Funding
This analysis is part of the Early Assessment of COVID-19 epidemiology and Vaccine/anti-viral Effectiveness (EAVE II) study. EAVE II is funded by the Medical Research Council (MR/R008345/1) with the support of BREATHE - The Health Data Research Hub for Respiratory Health [MC_PC_19004], which is funded through the UK Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and delivered through Health Data Research UK. Additional support has been provided through the Scottish Government DG Health and Social Care.
